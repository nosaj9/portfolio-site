            <h1>My second family</h1>
            <p>I joined my first acappella group during junior year of high school and honestly I think it was one of the best decisions I ever made.</p>
            <p>I've met so many amazing people, discovered a new form of expressing myself, experienced the unmatched thrill of performing on stage, and opened so many new doors for me.</p>
            <p>
                My current acappella group is called <span className="highlight">Dacadence</span> and we hold concerts, perform around campus and for the community, 
                and compete in competitions such as the International Competition for Collegiate Acappella (<a href="https://varsityvocals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="pagelink">ICCA</a>).
            </p>
            <p>The bond you develop by singing with others is really something unique and something can't experience through any other means.</p>
            <p>I've come to grow so close to my fellow members in the group through our experiences together and it truly feels like my second family.</p>
            <p>And if you were wondering, my voice part is <span className="highlight">Bass</span>.</p>
